# Unexpected IsEmpty() Behavior in VBScript

This repository demonstrates a subtle issue in VBScript related to the `IsEmpty()` function and how it handles Variant variables that might contain empty strings ("") or numerical zeros (0). This behavior differs from other programming languages.

## Bug Description

The VBScript `IsEmpty()` function returns `True` when a variable is uninitialized or contains a `Null` value. However, it surprisingly returns `False` if the variant variable holds an empty string ("") or a zero (0), which is a common source of unexpected behavior if the programmer intended to check for these explicitly.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Run `bug.vbs`.
2. Observe that the script doesn't treat empty strings or zeros as empty, leading to unexpected output.

## Solution

The solution file, `bugSolution.vbs`, demonstrates a more robust approach. It explicitly checks for empty strings ("") and zero values (0) using a more reliable methodology, giving the programmer more control.

## Note

Always explicitly check for empty strings and zero values using appropriate comparison operators instead of relying solely on `IsEmpty()` in VBScript for more reliable and predictable code.
